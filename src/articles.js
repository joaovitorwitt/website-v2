      "Artificial Intelligence in education. Do we actually need to worry and do something or it's all fun and games? Find out here.",
    content: `
    <p>“Artificial Intelligence will be disruptive, but few people understand that education is going to be in the first frontline.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>Right now, there are two problems in education: what we teach and how we teach.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence, for some people, those words combined might induce fear, some sort of apocalyptic dystopia.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Perhaps it is because Artificial Intelligence has always been presented as a threat to human civilization.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We can just look at movies like Blade Runner, The Terminator, The Matrix, and A Space Odyssey.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What do all these movies have in common?</p>
    <br>
    <p>You are right! Some sort of advanced AI technology that becomes self-aware, and instantly represents a danger to the human race.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So as programmers and engineers, let's find out how this applies to education, what we can do to improve education and prevent potential</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Strong Implications For Better Or Worse</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Chat GPT, Siri, Alexa, facial recognition, speech recognition, predicting stocks, and medical diagnoses.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Those are all a few examples of AI being implemented in its full capacity for our current time.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But we need to clarify that we don't know what AI will look like in the future. Some people say that it will improve our lives and help humanity reach a crucial point in our evolution.</p>
    <br>
    <p>While other people say that it will turn against us and wipe out all human race.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Is it not wrong to say that we are pretty much a captain navigating on the ocean for the first time, we can't be sure if we are going to find a land full of gold or else…</p>
    <br>
    <p>With all that in mind, we must carefully ask the right questions when it comes to AI in education, like:</p>
    <br>
    <p>How exactly will AI work in classrooms? How will AI affect the role of teachers? What are the short-term and long-term impact on students?</p>
    <br>
    <p>Before we even consider answering these questions, we need to get technical and look at some possible implementations of Artificial Intelligence in education environments.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Practical Examples Of AI In Education</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Let's say we create a machine learning model that can gather some data about students solving some mathematical problem, with this model we can start identifying underline misconceptions and struggles that each individual student faces.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This alone is huge, because teachers, researchers, educators will start to understand more about the process of learning and how learning can differ for each person.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But what will these learning tools look like you might ask?</p>
    <br>
    <p>For starters, one of the practical examples would be students having a one-to-one interaction with computers that provide some sort of personalized learning.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In the US, the average class size is 25, for just 1 teacher. It is fair to say that most of the time the students are not getting the necessary attention when it comes to learning.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So In this context the AI would offer personalized instructions for each student's needs.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another problem that classrooms face is that the students have different learning paces.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Some students will find a mathematical problem easy to solve, while others might struggle to solve or not even solve at all.</p>
    <br>
    <p>How do we solve this problem?</p>
    <br>
    <p>One of the ways is to create adaptive learning systems that can dynamically adjust the learning material based on the students' performance.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This could help teachers identify sections where an individual is performing well and sections where the student struggles the most.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This alone would make an excellent impact on the student’s learning, since they would be tackling the areas where they are struggling and actually learning by doing hard things.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But again, we don't know the consequences of this, like, how we would make sure that students are on the same level?</p>
    <br>
    <p>And this raises another question: Do we need to keep students on the same level in a classroom?</p>
    <br>
    <p>For the students that are more advanced on some topic, it would be like running with some extra weight on their bodies.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Those so-called “tools” are often referred to as AIED (artificial intelligence in education) tools.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>It All Comes Full Cycle</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Would be cool if we could snap a finger and all of the world's classrooms have those kinds of tools, but we know that would be impossible and we also don't know the implications for that.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What we need is a gradual implementation of these technologies. For example, Social Media usage wasn't overnight, it took some years for people to start using it on a daily basis.</p>
    <br>
    <p>AI in education wouldn't be no different, especially AI in education.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As Machine Learning Engineers, we will need to make sure the systems and models are the best version they can be since we don't know the implications of these hypothetical tools.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We also don't know how this will affect students individually, why might work for some students more than others.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It is worth mentioning all sorts of social issues that AI might bring along, but we won't discuss them in this article, I will leave this for the experts in the subject.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Technology is evolving faster than the traditional education systems.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Today when students need to write an essay, they can just ask Chat GPT.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Why bother doing themselves when a “robot” can do a lot faster, even with poor quality. Who cares?</p>
    <br>
    <p>That's what happens when the educational system places more value in grades than in actual learning.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As a wise man once said: “I may be a madman, but I am a conscious madman”.</p>

      "Is AI really all that? Should we manage our expectations about AI? Find out about these important questions that are often overlooked regarding Artificial Intelligence",
    content: `
    <p>What makes a topic interesting? What dictates the hype? Can we know what is going to be the next big thing in our society?</p><br>
    <p>These are some of the questions that I ask myself when everybody starts talking about something, whether it is an event, a new product, or in our case… AI.</p><br>
    
    <h3>what AI has achieved so far</h3><br>
    
    <p>Let's not waste any time here and talk about what AI has achieved so far.</p><br>
    
    <p>Autonomous cars</p><br>
    <p>Ability to answer questions naturally</p><br>
    <p>Digital assistants like Alexa and Siri</p><br>
    <p>Image classification</p><br>
    <p>Speech recognition</p><br>
    
    <p>So keep that in mind, dear reader, the field of AI has done a lot of stuff in the last few years. But why do we need to manage our expectations?</p><br>
    
    <h3>don't believe the short-term hype</h3><br>
    
    <p>Expectations are a funny thing, they can be considered a double-edged sword.</p><br>
    
    <p>On December 10th of 2020, a little game called Cyberpunk 2077 was released, saying it was going to break every record in the game industry.</p><br>
    
    <p>If you are familiar with this story then you know exactly what happened.</p><br>
    
    <p>The game had huge expectations around it, people were crazy to see all the revolutionary stuff that was being shown and said about the game.</p><br>
    
    <p>But when it hit the shelves, and people got to play it was full of problems and bugs, and people’s expectations for the game crashed bigger than the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs.</p><br>
    
    <p>That leads us to the new hype of Artificial Intelligence.</p><br>
    
    <p>Believed it or not, this is not the first time AI is being hyped to a point of such intensity.</p><br>
    
    <p>It all started in the 60s, with Symbolic AI.</p><br>
    
    <p>What is Symbolic AI you may ask?</p><br>
    
    <p>Back in the day, engineers believed that the key to creating intelligent systems was to hardcode a high number of rules within a system that eventually this system would become ‘intelligent’.</p><br>
    
    <p>All this stuff lead to a full wave of investments, followed by disappointments</p><br>
    
    <p>Because soon they noticed that all of this would not come true.</p><br>
    
    <p>So companies started to stop investing in research, marking the first AI winter.</p><br>
    
    <p>It took some years but finally, AI made its recovery.</p><br>
    
    <p>In the 80s, a new promise came along with an array of successes, and companies started to invest again.</p><br>
    
    <p>Oh no, they realized!</p><br>
    
    <p>Those systems were expensive to maintain, difficult to scale into something profitable, and there was no real-world value to that. You can guess what the companies did.</p><br>
    
    <p>But along came a method that would be known until this day, Machine Learning.</p><br>
    
    <p>With the rise of machines, lots of data being available in digital form, computers evolving faster than a Ferrari at 200 mph, and a big research community, the field arose from the ashes as people began to see the potential behind all of that.</p><br>
    
    <p>And today we can see all these factors combined in the form of autonomous cars, digital assistants, intelligent systems, and much more.</p><br>
    
    <p>But we have to ask ourselves a question: How far will this go?</p><br>
    
    <p>As I mentioned in the beginning, expectations are a funny thing when it comes to promises and optimism.</p><br>
    
    <p>Right now the world is seeing an intense form of optimism regarding AI, but what if we are not able to go further than this with the evolution of AI? What if we are in the corner of another AI winter?</p><br>
    
    <p>So, for the sake of all people in the world, it is best to moderate these expectations, making it crystal clear what AI can do and what AI cannot do.</p><br>
    
    <p>With that said, I might be wrong and in 5 years AI will take all of our jobs and rule society, I guess we will never know for sure.</p><br>
    
    <p>Enough of this, let's look at the bright side of AI, and how it can be used to solve a lot of problems that we face today in our lives.</p><br>
    
    
    <h3>The Promise of AI</h3><br>
    
    <p>I think it is fair to say that the future of AI is looking pretty epic.</p><br>
    
    <p>Maybe we can consider some of the breakthroughs in AI equal to the discovery of penicillin.</p><br>
    
    <p>Back in the day, penicillin was crucial to saving millions of lives around the world, and it keeps saving until this day.</p><br>
    
    <p>I mean, perhaps we can say that AI is doing the same thing on a much smaller scale.</p><br>
    
    <p>Recently AI was used to identify a cancer cell in a patient's body, predict diseases, and also detect early signs of fatal diseases.</p><br>
    
    <p>Great stuff, indeed.</p><br>
    
    <p>Who knows how many lives this could save in the future?</p><br>
    
    <p>But it is fair to point out that most of this research stuff is not 100% being used in today's world.</p><br>
    
    <p>Your doctor doesn’t use AI, your gym doesn't use AI, and also your dentist doesn’t use AI.</p><br>
    
    <p>But one thing we know for sure is that the Ai is coming, we don’t know when and how but it’s coming.</p><br>
    
    <p>Today we can ask anyone on the street if they use smartphones and they probably will say yes. But get a time machine and go back 10 years, and start asking people the same question, I bet that you will find people that do not possess said technology.</p><br>
    
    <p>Same thing with social media, today everyone uses it.</p><br>
    
    <p>The point I am making is that stuff like this takes time to transition. Then, after that, people will start to see the potential of AI, the ability that AI has to transform the world we live in a fantastic way.</p><br>
    
    <p>To finish up, the best thing we can do right now is see the long-term vision, and not fall for the short-term hype.</p><br>

    description:
      "Is it really enough to just know how to code in today's world? Find out how commit messages can impact the dev world.",
    content: `
    <p>Have you ever received a text from someone and your mind can't make heads or tails about it.</p><br>
    <p>Or when the doctor hands you a piece of paper that contains the prescription for your medication and the letter looks like arabic.</p><br>
    <p>I’ve been there, you’ve been there, we all have been there.</p><br>
    
    <h3>The commit messages on github are the same thing when regarding communication and clarity.</h3><br>
    
    <p>If you check some of the commit messages you will see what I am talking about.</p><br>
    
    <p>Sometimes it is not enough to just write good code, you need to be able to express your code into human words.</p><br>
    
    <p>So put on a seatbelt, and let's look at how commit messages can affect you as a developer, as well as the code you are working on.</p><br>
    
    
    <h3>why is it important</h3><br>
    
    <p>Communication is the foundation of the human race, without it we would be lost.</p><br>
    
    <p>Imagine that you are going to work on some big open-source project for the first time and then you see thousands of commit messages like “fix bugs”, “changes”, “update”.</p><br>
    
    <p>At this point you are simply lost in the woods my friend.</p><br>
    
    <p>You must first think about the people that will read your message.</p><br>
    
    <p>So you need to be precise when writing commit messages, avoiding room for interpretation.</p><br>
    
    <p>The people working on the project need to be on the same page when it comes to the programming world.</p><br>
    
    <p>Without collaboration and communication there is no way the project will evolve into something.</p><br>
    
    <p>Ask questions and you will have the answers</p><br>
    
    <p>Next time, when you write you commit message, think of these questions:</p><br>
    
    <p>What was the purpose of those changes?</p><br>
    
    <p>Why were the changes necessary in the first place?</p><br>
    
    <p>What problem is being addressed?</p><br>
    
    <p>After you answer these questions you will have the perfect commit message ready to go.</p><br>
    
    
    <h3>the future will reward you</h3><br>
    
    <p>A good commit message can save hours when developing and debugging code.</p><br>
    
    <p>You can choose from those two commit messages below:</p><br>
    
    <p>git commit -m “Update styles”</p><br>
    
    <p>git commit -m “Adjust font size and padding header to improve the mobile responsiveness”</p><br>
    
    <p>Which one do you pick? I will give you one try…</p><br>
    
    <p>Given that, you must consider taking some time to really write a commit message that makes the people looking at your code understand why this change is being made, not just what is changing.</p><br>
    
    <p>Essentially, when you write a good commit message, you are making a deal with the future.</p><br>
    
    <p>Dedicating some time to come up with a solid commit message that will help you and the people working on the project.</p><br>
    
    
    <h3>Some standard commit messages</h3><br>
    
    <p>The idea is to segment the different types of commit messages depending on the changes made.</p><br>
    
    <p>You can start you commit message with one of these words: feat, docs, fix, style, test, perf</p><br>
    
    <p>Feat - feat is used when you just implemented a new feature</p><br>
    
    <p>Docs - Documentation changes</p><br>
    
    <p>Fix - fix a bug or issue on the codebase</p><br>
    
    <p>Style - Changes related to the style, always good to be descriptive.</p><br>
    
    <p>Test - Adding new tests or updating old ones.</p><br>
    
    <p>Perf - Improve overall code performance, like refactoring or optimization</p><br>
    
    <p>Right off the bat we can see how prefixing our commit messages with a specific keyword can help us distinguish between multiple areas of development.</p><br>
    
    
    <h3>You can use this</h3><br>
    
    <p>Of course it is worth mentioning that there is no universal rule when writing commit messages.</p><br>
    
    <p>Most of the time depends on the project that might have their own guidelines for commit messages.</p><br>
    
    <p>But there are always some conventional formats that you can start using.</p><br>
    
    <p>Like this one:</p><br>
    
    <p>&lt;type&gt; (&lt;scope&gt;): &lt;subject&gt;</p><br>
    
    <p>Type: Describes what area you are making the changes or adding stuff. Like mentioned above, some types include feat, docs, fix, and etc.</p><br>
    
    <p>Scope: This one is optional, but it doesn't hurt to have. The scope points to the part of code that is being changed, it can be a component, a file, an api, and so on.</p><br>
    
    <p>Subject: A concise description of the change. No need for long sentences, remember what I said earlier, take some time to really think of a good description that highlights the main objective of the message.</p><br>
    
    <p>Here is an example using this type of format:</p><br>
    
    <p>feat (authentication) : Add password reset functionality</p><br>
    
    <p>So next, before starting some project, whether it is only you working or a whole team, invest a time into the guidelines of the commit messages.</p><br>
    
    <p>Think of how the message will be written and what will be on the message.</p><br>
    
    <p>Later down the road when your project starts to scale, you will be glad that you made the effort into writing good commit messages.</p><br>

      "There are programmers out there who spend more time trying to find the perfect tutorial than actually writing code.",
    content: `
    <p>“The only way to learn new programming languages is by writing programs in it”</p>
    <p>— Dennis Ritchie</p><br>
    
    <p>To get started learning programming you just need four things.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Know about variables, conditions, loops, and functions.</p>
    <br>
    <p>After that you just need to write code.</p><br>
    
    <p>You don't need a roadmap for programming, you do not need a book, or another tutorial.</p><br>
    
    <p>Back in the day when a friend of mine started on programming he watched a 10 hour video tutorial on JavaScript.</p>
    <br>
    <p>After he finished the tutorial he came to me and said: “I finished this tutorial then i went to open the code editor and couldn't write a single line of code”.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I immediately said to him: “exactly”.</p><br>
    
    <p>There is a term for that in the word of programming, it is called tutorial hell.</p>
    <br>
    <p>And it is the worst mistake that anyone starting in programming can make.</p><br>
    
    <p>In fact, most people do not realize that, so let me explain the process of tutorial hell.</p><br>
    
    <p>Imagine that you finished your 10 hours course on JavaScript, great stuff indeed, then you open a new vscode window, and just like my friend, you just cannot write code.</p><br>
    
    <p>Tutorial hell is simply that, not being able to code without some guidance.</p><br>
    
    <h3>How to escape</h3><br>
    
    <p>Just like Dante trying to escape the hell (or purgatory), you first will need to know the following:</p>
    <br>
    <p>Functions, variables, loops, and conditions.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Really the basics of programming. With just that you can build anything you imagine.</p><br>
    
    <p>But how would I do that you might ask?</p>
    <br>
    <p>Well, as they say, through trial and error.</p>
    <br>
    <p>After getting the four basics out of the way you might want to pick a stack that you are interested in.</p><br>
    
    <p>If you like front-end, pick HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and later down the road a framework.</p>
    <br>
    <p>On the other hand, if it is back-end you can choose Python, PHP, NodeJS, Rust, C#, and so on. You can also choose game development or mobile development, there are so many options available.</p><br>
    
    <h3>The cool part</h3><br>
    
    <p>Now comes the most awesome part about all of this, you will actually write code. Wow, imagine that.</p><br>
    
    <p>Select some project that catches your attention and try to create on your own, or replicate if it is from some tutorial.</p><br>
    
    <p>And when you get stuck building the project, believe me you will, just search the problem and go again.</p><br>
    
    <p>Perhaps you might need to read some documentation, or even watch a video dedicated to the problem you are facing. No shame in that, because it is you that is actually doing the heavy lifting.</p><br>
    
    <p>You are not just copying code from some tutorial.</p><br>
    
    <p>By doing that you will be able to test your problem solving skills, and learn from actually doing the thing.</p><br>
    
    <p>Programming has this false feeling of learning by watching others doing, but at the end of the day you are not really learning.</p><br>
    
    <p>You will never learn how to play some sport, by watching others playing. And, at the end of the day, programming is the same thing.</p>

    content: `
    <p>“Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. There is nothing obvious that you can do to make it better... And if you try to imagine improvements, you are sent back to the current code.”</p>
    <p>— Michael Feathers</p><br>
    
    <p>There are hundreds of definitions for clean code. And all of them can be extremely different, but at the end of the day, they all are guided by the same ideas.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We can say that clean code is code that satisfies the reader, much like a good night's sleep, being efficient in its implementation. And above all, as mentioned by Michael Feathers, the code needs to be written by someone who cares about the process, someone who has dedicated their time to keeping the code simple, effective, and well-structured, with great attention to detail.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Similar to a good story, the writing of the code should expose tensions in the problem to be solved, these tensions should guide the person reading the code to a climax, as the problems are resolved.</p>
    <br>
    <p>With that in mind, in this article, we will comment on some rules you can follow if you are interested in writing code that sets you apart among other programmers.</p><br>
    
    <h3>Use meaningful names</h3><br>
    
    <p>In the world of programming, we use names for everything, whether it's naming files, folders, variables, functions, classes, and so on. And because of that, it's important to choose names that perfectly describe the purpose of the code.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Therefore, it's not a mistake to say that names should reflect the code's intention. Choosing a good name may take time, but it's a great long-term decision, potentially saving much more time.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The name you give to your function or variable should answer basic questions. For example, it should say what it does, why it exists, and what it's used for.</p><br>
    
    <h3>Be cautious with comments</h3><br>
    
    <p>A good comment goes beyond just explaining the code's implementation.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Yes, I know, writing comments helps you and others understand the purpose of the code. It's also valid to point out that programmers should have the discipline to write relevant and accurate comments.</p>
    <br>
    <p>However, some care is needed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The primary purpose of comments is to compensate for the failure to express oneself well in code. Just like living beings evolve and change over time, the same happens with code.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When different people work on the same project, the code may be changed, and comments run the risk of not being updated or getting disconnected from the code.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Therefore, focus your attention on writing code that others can read and understand, at least to some extent, the code's intention.</p><br>
    
    <h3>Keep your code organized</h3><br>
    
    <p>When someone looks at disorganized and poorly structured code, they think that the final result of the code will be the same.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Because of this, you need to choose a set of rules that will ensure your code is well-formatted and apply them consistently. Especially if you're working with a group of people.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Having well-organized and structured code is synonymous with communication, and that's very important for programmers. Therefore, always use spaces and indentation where necessary, consider breaking your code into functions with a single purpose.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It's important to remember that a feature you create today is likely to change tomorrow, but good formatting and organization, those remain.</p><br>
    
    <h3>Test your code</h3><br>
    
    <p>How will you know that your code works as desired if you don't test it? The code you write for testing is as important as the code that goes into production.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Therefore, dedicating some of your time to writing test code is essential because when the source code changes, the test code also changes. And depending on the quality of the test code, it can be harder to fix in the long run, and the problem can become a snowball.</p>

    title: "The Computer Science Landscape",
    description:
      "Computer Science is often disregarded as a science. Take a look at how big it is.",
    content: `<p>Humans built computers to expand our brains. Initially, scientists created computers to perform mathematical operations or repetitive tasks, but they ended up being extremely useful for various other things, such as problem-solving, communication, artificial intelligence, and more.</p>
    <br>
    <p>All of this is based on just zeros and ones (0, 1). With the advancement of technology, computers have become increasingly powerful in a very short period. To put it into perspective, the Apollo moon landing could be accomplished using a few Nintendo consoles.</p>
    <br>
    <p>With this in mind, you might be wondering what Computer Science is and what it studies. Computer Science studies what computers can do, covering a wide range of subjects. In this article, I will divide it into three parts: theory, computer engineering, and applications.</p><br>

    <h3>Some Historical Context</h3><br>
    
    <p>To begin, let's start with the father of Computer Science, Alan Turing. He developed the concept called the Turing Machine, which is a concept given to a computer that can be used for various things. Eventually, people created new designs for computers, but these designs are all equivalent to a Turing Machine.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A Turing Machine is composed of a long tape containing symbols, the central part (head) that can read and write symbols on the tape, and the register that stores information along with a list of instructions.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Today, the tape is like a computer's memory (RAM) and the head is the CPU. Lambda Calculus is used in computers as the basis for programming languages.</p><br>
    
    <h3>Computability Theory</h3><br>
    
    <p>This is an area of mathematics and computer science that seeks to perform procedures effectively following a set of rules. This theory classifies problems that, due to their own nature, can or cannot be solved.</p>
    <br>
    <p>An example of this is the Halting Problem, which tries to predict whether a program will stop functioning or continue running forever.</p><br>


    <h3>Computational Complexity</h3><br>
    <p>Another area of Computer Science is computational complexity. Computational complexity aims to classify and compare the difficulty of solving problems.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There are problems that can theoretically be solved, but they require enormous computational power and would take more time than the age of the universe. Therefore, computational complexity attempts to classify these problems.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There are several real-world problems that fall into this category. Scientists have various tricks to approximate these answers, but it’s never certain if these answers are the best ones.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Algorithms</h3><br>
<p>An algorithm is a set of instructions designed to solve a specific problem. An algorithm is like a recipe for baking a cake.</p>
<br>
<p>One of the main goals of an algorithm is to perform a task or solve a problem as efficiently as possible, meaning as quickly as possible. Different algorithms may arrive at the same result in different times, and this is studied in algorithm complexity.</p>
<br>
<h3>Information Theory</h3><br>
<p>Information theory is another area of computer science that studies the properties of information and how this information can be stored, measured, and shared.</p>
<br>
<p>An example of this is how much you can compress information, making it occupy less memory while preserving the information completely. You can learn more about this in the theory of codes.</p>
<br>
<h3>Cryptography</h3><br>
<p>We use cryptography in messaging apps every day. Cryptography is extremely important when it comes to securely sending information over the internet.</p>
<br>
<p>There are various types of cryptography that use complex mathematical operations to keep information secure.</p>
<br>
<h3>Graph Theory</h3><br>
<p>In mathematics and computer science, graph theory is the branch that studies graphs, a mathematical structure used to represent relationships between objects or information. A set of vertices is connected by edges or lines, forming a graph.</p>
<br>
<h3>Data Structures</h3><br>
<p>In computing, data structures are a way of storing and managing information with the goal of accessing and modifying information efficiently.</p>
<br>
<p>Some examples of data structures are arrays, stacks, hash tables, queues, heaps, graphs, and linked lists.</p>
<br>
<h3>Computational Geometry</h3><br>
<p>Computational geometry is another area of computer science that involves the creation, analysis, and implementation of efficient algorithms for solving geometric problems.</p>
<br>
<p>To keep it clear, there are several other areas that I haven’t mentioned to avoid making the article too long. Examples of these areas include quantum computing, parallel and distributed programming, and much more.</p>
<br>
<h3>Computer Engineering</h3><br>
<p>In today’s world, computers are required to do hundreds of things at the same time, which can be a challenge in computer development. Therefore, scientists need to create them to be fast and efficient.</p>
<br>
<p>Any task you perform on a computer goes through the CPU. When you perform multiple tasks simultaneously, the CPU needs to switch between these tasks to complete them as quickly as possible, and this is controlled by a scheduler, whose main function is to optimize task execution.</p>
<br>
<h3>Computer Architecture</h3><br>
<p>In computing, computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe implementations, functionalities, and the organization of systems. Basically, it is how a processor is developed to perform certain tasks.</p>
<br>
<p>CPUs serve a general purpose, GPUs are implemented in graphics, and FPGAs can be programmed to be extremely fast for a specific set of activities.</p>
<br>
<h3>Softwares & Programming Languages</h3><br>
<p>Software is written in some programming language. Programming languages are how humans give instructions to computers, and these languages can vary depending on the task.</p>
<br>
<p>This code that humans write needs to be converted into machine code that computers understand. This is where compilers come in.</p>
<br>
<h3>Operational Systems</h3><br>
<p>The operating system is the most important logical part of a computer. It controls what the user interacts with and sees, and also controls how programs will run on the physical part of the computer.</p>

<p>As a result, developing a good operating system can be a significant challenge.</p>
<br>
<h3>Software Engineering</h3><br>
<p>This leads us to software engineering, where you write a set of instructions determining the computer’s actions. Creating software needs to be as efficient as possible and free of errors. Some of the best practices people follow to build good software are object-oriented design, unit testing, and version control.</p>
<br>
<p>“Creating good software is a form of art because you need to convert your creative ideas into logical instructions.”</p>
<br>
<p>Other highly important areas worth mentioning are networking, where multiple computers communicate to solve a specific problem, data management in which computers store and manage large amounts of information, and performance, which focuses on analyzing how computers perform in different tasks.</p>
<br>
<h3>Applications</h3><br>
<p>This is the part where computers can solve real-world problems, and this is present in various programs, apps, and websites we use in our daily lives.</p>
<br>
<p>When you go on a trip, you want to have the best trip money can buy, solving an optimization problem. Optimization problems consist of finding the best or most efficient path, potentially saving millions of dollars for companies.</p>
<br>
<p>This is related to the Boolean Satisfiability Problem, where you consider whether a logical formula can be satisfied or not. This was one of the first problems considered almost impossible to solve.</p>
<br>
<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3><br>
<p>Artificial intelligence is one of the main fields of research in computer science. Computers have the capacity to extend our thoughts, meaning developing computers that can think for themselves.</p>
<br>
<h3>Machine Learning</h3><br>
<p>One of the study areas of artificial intelligence is machine learning. Its main function is to create algorithms and techniques that allow computers to learn based on large amounts of information.</p>
<br>
<p>With this, they use the learning for something useful, such as making decisions on their own or classifying something.</p>
<br>
<h3>Computer Vision</h3><br>
<p>Another field of computer science is computer vision, making computers see the same way humans do, using image processing techniques.</p>
<br>
<h3>Natural Language Processing</h3><br>
<p>As the name suggests, natural language processing aims to make computers understand and communicate using human language or process vast amounts of information using words.</p>
<br>
<p>This uses knowledge representation, where information or words are organized according to their relationships, such as words with similar meanings.</p>
<br>
<h3>Big Data</h3><br>
<p>Machine learning algorithms have improved due to the immense amount of data available. Big Data’s function is to analyze and manage these large amounts of data.</p>
  <br>
<p>We also receive even more information due to the Internet of Things, including information and communications between objects through the internet.</p>
<br>
<h3>Hacking</h3><br>
<p>Hacking is considered by many to be illegal, and most of the time, it is. It involves trying to find vulnerabilities in computer systems to gain access to any available information. This can be used for both good and bad purposes.</p>
<br>
<h3>Computer-Human Interaction</h3><br>
<p>The goal of human-computer interaction is to make the use of systems and computers as easy and intuitive as possible.</p>
<br>
<p>Other fields worth mentioning are augmented reality, virtual reality, and telepresence. These areas aim to improve our experience with reality.</p>
<br>
<p>Finally, we have Robotics, providing computers with a physical form.</p>
<br>
<h3>Conclusion</h3><br>
<p>The goal of this article was to briefly introduce the different fields of computer science and some of its applications.</p>
<br>
<p>Computer Science is an area that is still evolving, although the physical aspect is reaching a limit as scientists are having difficulties in reducing the size of transistors.</p>
<br>
<p>Computers and technology have had a significant impact on humans, and it will be even more interesting to see how far it will go.</p>
